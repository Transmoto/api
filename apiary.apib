Penned each week by our man on the ground, Transmoto&#8217;s US Correspondent, Jason Weigandt, the USA Insider presents the story-behind-the-stories of the AMA supercross and motocross scene.<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>With a month to go before Anaheim 1 and the start\u00a0of the 2015 Monster Energy AMA Supercross series, business is picking up. While most trainers will tell you it\u2019s key to not overwork their riders throughout the year, this is the one time of year where work is indeed happening at full load, as everyone tries to expand their base and find a little extra sprint speed. In a few weeks, it will be too late.<\/p>\n<p>For most riders, that\u2019s meant more time in Florida and less time in California. Florida is a better place to train, because it\u2019s free of distractions. Testing goes better in California, where the teams are located, but testing and training are totally different. In fact, today I spoke with Eli Tomac, who was in the middle of a long drive from his Colorado home back to California, and he told me you can actually lose fitness if you test too much, because you\u2019re, \u201cJust dinking around for a few laps\u201d instead of doing long motos. The days, however, are long, so gym and cycling time is compromised. After some good early tests in California, Eli retreated to Colorado to get his fitness on point under the watch of his Dad, John \u2013 probably the gnarliest mountain bike racer America has ever produced. Now Honda has more stuff to test, so he\u2019s headed back out. \u201cI feel so much stronger than I did last year,\u201d Eli told me today. \u201cAnd we have a better base setting on the bike.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Similarly, Chad Reed was grinding hard in Florida for a while, really pushing the limits on fitness. Now he has more stuff to test so he\u2019ll have to do some time out west. The JGR Yamaha guys have a new stack of parts in, so they\u2019ve been testing all week, as well. At this point, everyone has built their fitness and their equipment to the 99% level. This is a last chance to find something else.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, there\u2019s still one rider who isn\u2019t sure if he can use everything he\u2019s learning this off season, and that\u2019s James Stewart. While he waits and waits for a decision from the World Anti-Doping Agency, which has the power to ban him from racing in 2015, James and the Yoshimura Suzuki team have gone about work as if it\u2019s business as usual. He tested early in the off-season (and I\u2019ve heard raves about the improved 2015 RM-Z450 chassis from Stewart\u2019s camp, and others) in California, then retreated to Florida. Now he\u2019s headed back to California for more testing. From what I\u2019ve heard, the decision to his fate, which dates back to a failed drug test last April, could come down as early as this Friday. Right now everyone on Stewart\u2019s team is operating under the same schedule as usual. Will James be able to put all this work to use next month?<\/p>\n","parent":null,"link":"http:\/\/staging.transmoto.com.au\/usa-insider-161-final-prep\/","date":"2014-12-04T14:20:16","modified":"2014-12-04T14:20:16","format":"standard","slug":"usa-insider-161-final-prep","guid":"https:\/\/transmoto.com.au\/?p=28140","excerpt":"<p>Find

Dale raced for the squad in 2009, 2012 and 2013 (he raced with the KTM Motocross Racing Team this year, but spent the majority of the season out with injuries). Dale acknowledged he was excited to be back with the championship-winning outfit. \u201cWe have worked well together in the past and I feel confident with the team&#8217;s direction,\u201d said Dale. \u201cI can\u2019t thank them enough for this great opportunity. I am looking forward to riding the Honda again after seeing the success Trey Canard had towards the middle of this year.\u201d No word yet as to whether or not KTM will be searching for a teammate to ride alongside Kirk Gibbs next year.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">&#8212;<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It&#8217;s been confirmed that Yamaha&#8217;s GYTR squad (Under 19s) will consist of Wilson Todd and Mitch Evans. Todd was thrust into Yamaha&#8217;s MXD race program at the 11th hour in 2014 after an injury was sustained by Joel Dinsdale. Todd charged his way to fourth in the MXD Championship, claimed a\u00a0dominant round win at Gladstone and scored several podium positions throughout the season. Evans joins\u00a0the team after destroying the opposition at this year&#8217;s Australian Junior Motocross Championship, taking home the 15 Years 125cc and 15 Years 250cc crowns. Evans was clearly a class above the rest and now is working hard to meet his goals in his first year\u00a0of\u00a0professional racing.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/transmoto.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/mitch_evans.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-28126\" src=\"https:\/\/transmoto.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/mitch_evans.jpg\" alt=\"mitch_evans\" width=\"753\" height=\"502\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">&#8212;<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Word on the street is that\u00a0Echuca-based shop, Whitten Brothers Kawasaki (WBR), will form the Proformance Kawasaki Racing Team, Kawasaki&#8217;s official MX Nationals MX2 effort, for season 2015. Stay tuned for further developments.<\/p>\n<p>&#8212;<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Young talent will fill the rider line-up of the all-new BCP Pro Circuit Honda Junior Development Team in its inaugural 2015 race season. The Factory Honda Junior race team will consist of three riders, including former National Junior MX Champion, Taj Marshall, Jai Constantinou and Morgan Fogarty. All three riders will contest Australia\u2019s major national events along with their chosen state championship races.<\/p>\n<p>&#8212;<\/p>\n<p>The final round of the 2014 Queensland Supercross Championship is set to take place this Saturday, December 6, at Jimboomba.

It was one of his first rides back on board a\u00a0dirt bike in over 18 months on Saturday, and he made his\u00a0off-road debut a special one, beating CDR Yamaha&#8217;s Daniel Milner in the finale to take home $1000. The 22-year-old was unlucky on Sunday, getting stuck in a tricky log section, forcing him to be eliminated early on. We&#8217;re looking forward to seeing the Boy from Bourke\u00a0in the off-road paddock full-time next year, set to contest every major event on the calendar with the KTM Enduro Racing Team.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">&#8212;<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Simmonds wasn&#8217;t the only one who made a debut at the Head2Head Endurocross over the weekend. Yamaha&#8217;s all-new 2015 WR250F was finally unleashed in competition. Chris Hollis whacked <em>Transmoto<\/em>&#8216;s Drift Stealth 2 POV camera on for a few laps prior to the weekend&#8217;s racing, to give us a look at the course, and to give us an idea of what the WR250F handles like. Hit play below and check it out.<\/p>\n<p><iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/om7UclMHPhk?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">&#8212;<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">One man who won&#8217;t be running around at domestic events next year will be Milner. Unfortunately, his last ride with CDR Yamaha in Australia didn&#8217;t go so well \u2013 he crashed on the first straight of the Head2Head Endurocross finale\u00a0and was forced to watch on as Tye shot away. He took a slam to his wrist and decided to sit out Sunday&#8217;s competition, to prevent doing any further damage prior to heading to America next year to contest the 2015 Grand National Cross Country (GNCC) series. It&#8217;s been an absolute pleasure having you here for the last couple of years, mate. Plenty of trophies to show for it!<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">&#8212;<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Prior to the weekend&#8217;s Head2Head Endurocross racing, we pulled aside Simmonds, Hollis and KTM&#8217;s Daniel &#8220;Chucky&#8221; Sanders to gain an insight into the way Dave and Colin Robbins had put together the tight, technical course. Simmonds explained how the tyres were positioned, Chucky broke down the treacherous rock section, and Hollis let us know how the balancing-beam logs were going to work.

This year marks the fourth year of a new 450SX-F Factory Edition motorcycle and the first year that KTM has released a 250SX-F Factory Edition.<\/p>\n<p>For the 2015 model, KTM has stepped up the game once more and developed a whole new generation SX model motorcycle.<\/p>\n<p>Both the 450SX-F and 250SX-F Factory Editions have been developed with the primary objectives of weight reduction and mass centralisation for improved performance. Both motors have been completely redesigned to be lighter and more compact while producing more power. The new engine cases on both models are redesigned to centralise the rotating mass of the crankshaft and clutch while reducing the overall length. Both models have a reworked Keihin Engine Management System with new 44mm throttle body and a new electronic launch control for efficient starts. New cylinder heads, revised valve trains, new combustion chamber geometries and optimised ports increase performance along with a new five-speed transmission on both models to provide precise and easy shifting.<\/p>\n<p>The chassis is completely reworked with a lighter chromoly steel frame that provides improved handling and energy absorption. A lighter subframe and swingarm match the new frame characteristics. The WP 4CS fork and brand new WP shock have been specifically designed for motocross and features revised damping settings optimised for the new chassis. The new upgrades result in roughly a\u00a0three-kilogram\u00a0weight-reduction on the 250 SX-F Factory Edition and over four kilograms\u00a0on the 450.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/transmoto.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/ktm_0002.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-28148\" src=\"https:\/\/transmoto.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/ktm_0002.jpg\" alt=\"ktm_0002\" width=\"753\" height=\"502\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>The Factory Edition models come with other add-on benefits including: Red Bull KTM limited-edition graphics, Selle Dalla Valle Factory Race Team seat, orange-anodised rubber mounted triple clamps, lightweight Galfer Wave rotors, CNC-machined hubs, high-end Excel rims fitted with Dunlop GEOMAX MX32 tires, KTM\/ODI lock-on grips, KTM PowerParts fork mounted start device, engine map select switch and a KTM PowerParts hour meter.<\/p>\n<p>For 2015, the 450SX-F Factory Edition will be the bike of choice for Red Bull KTM Factory Team riders Ryan Dungey and his new teammate Dean Wilson. In addition, the BTO Sports\/KTM Team will also use this race machine with team riders Andrew Short and Justin Bratyon. In the the 250SX Series and 250 Motocross Championship, Red Bull KTM Factory Team riders Marvin Musquin and Justin Hill will utilise the 250SX-F Factory Edition alongside the Troy Lee Designs\/Lucas

# Group Premium

This section of the API describes the end-points for accessing the premium content. Except for `/premium/<id>` all these endpoints are public.

## Premium Categories [/premium/cat]

Get a list of available premium content categories. Categories are not nested so there will only be a top-level array returned.

**This is a PUBLIC endpoint.**

**Response key description:**

* *term_id*: the category ID (used in `/premium/cat/{id}` endpoint)
* *name*: the category name
* *description*: the category description
* *count*: the number of articles published in the category
* *featured_image*: the URL to the category featured image (string), the image width (integer), the image height (integer), and whether it's the full-sized image, or resized version (boolean).

### Get Categories [GET]

+ Response 503 (application/json)

        [{"code":"json_trader_disabled","message":"Sorry, Transmoto's premium content is currently unavailable."}]

## Get Category Content [/premium/cat/{id}/{?filter%5Bposts_per_page%5D,page}]

Get a list of premium content in the category. This endpoint includes NO substantial content (see `/premium/{id}`)

The returned results are ordered by free articles first, then the published date. 

Special attention should be paid to the 'free' key in the response, which signifies whether that particular post is paid for, or a freebie. If `free` is true then no payment should be made to access that post's content, and you can safely request the post using the `/premium/{id}` endpoint.

The `featured_image` URL can be glemed from the `featured_image.attachment_meta.sizes` node. 

The reponse keys are similar to the `/posts/` endpoint, but specific information has been removed to prevent unauthorised access.

**This is a PUBLIC endpoint.**

### Get Category Content [GET]
+ Parameters
    + id (integer) ... The category ID that we should get the posts from. See `/premium/cat` for a list of valid categories.
    + filter%5Bposts_per_page%5D (optional,integer) ... The number of posts to retreive. By default this is 16.
    + page (optional,integer)  ... Select which page of posts you should get. This functions exactly like the website's pagination. The most current posts will be on page 1.
